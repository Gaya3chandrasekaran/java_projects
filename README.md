This file has collection of java projects as apart of my learning coursework.

**1.Simple Banking Application**
  Simple Banking Application is a simple Java project for simple banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, exit. This application enables transactions and operations  like money transfer and balance inquiry been done in seconds. 

**2.Array Merge:**
  The first Main.java is based ion merging two arrays. Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.nums1 and nums2 are merged into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

  The Second Median.java focuses on determining median of two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
